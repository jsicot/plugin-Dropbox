Goal
====
This plugin is designed for Omeka and allows user to batch upload files to a specific directory (using FTP, SFTP ...) and then associate them with an item in the archive.

The plugin is developped by CHNM ( https://github.com/omeka/plugin-Dropbox )

Bordeaux 3 enhancements
=======================
This specific version has been developped by Bordeaux 3 to allow association with an item of a whole directory. 
You can put inside plugin/files directories containing all pictures from an item for example and associate the dir with an item without checking all files one by one.
